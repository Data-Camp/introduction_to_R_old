## What's a data frame?

You may remember from the chapter about matrices that all the elements that you put in a matrix should be of the same type. Back then, your data set on Star Wars only contained numeric elements. 

When doing a market research survey, however, you often have different types of question.  For example

- 'Are you married?' has a 'yes/no' response, so you should store the answer in a `logical` vector.
- 'How old are you?' has a numeric response, so you should store the answer in a `numeric` vector.
- 'What is your opinion on this product?' is an open-ended question, that has a text response, so you should store the answer in a `character` vector.

Rather than having separate vector variables for the response to each question, it would be useful to have a single variable where each column contains the response to a question. This is exactly what a data frame is for! Like a matrix, a data frame is a rectangular block of data.  This time, each column can contain a different data type.

- The columns of a data frames are sometimes called **fields** or ** variables**.
- The rows of a data frame are sometimes called **observations**.

Data frames appear in many data analysis environments, but sometimes have different names. They are the same thing as database tables or MATLAB tables. In SAS, Stata, and SPSS, they are called "datasets". Worksheets in a spreadsheet are similar, but have less rules on how they are structured.

*** =instructions

In this chapter you will work with the built-in example data frame [`esoph`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/esoph).

* Type `esoph` to print the contents of that data frame.

*** =hint

Just type `esoph`.

## Quick, have a look at your data set

The [`esoph`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/esoph) data frame takes up several screens worth of output. (Unless you have a *really* big monitor and a *really* small font size.)

Working with large data sets is not uncommon in data analysis. When you work with (extremely) large data sets and data frames, your first task as a data analyst is to develop a clear understanding of its structure and main elements. Therefore, it is often useful to show only a small part of the entire data set. 

So how to do this in R? Well, the function [`head()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. Similarly, the function [`tail()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) prints out the last observations in your data set.

Both [`head()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) and [`tail()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) print a top line called the 'header', which contains the names of the different variables in your data set. To use them, pass the name of the data frame, and optionally the number of rows to return.  For example, the following code looks at the first two rows from the built-in [`sleep`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/sleep) data frame.

```{r}
head(sleep, n = 2)
##   extra group ID
## 1   0.7     1  1
## 2  -1.6     1  2
```

If you don't specify the `n` argument, six rows of data will be returned.

*** =instructions

* Call [`head()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) on the [`esoph`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/esoph) data frame to see the first six rows of data.
* Call [`tail()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) on the [`esoph`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/esoph) data frame, with the argument `n = 3`, to see the last three rows of data.

*** =hint
* `head(x)` will show the first six observations of a data frame named `x`.
* `tail(x, n = 10)` will show the last ten observations of a data frame named `x`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Call head() on esoph


# Call tail() on esoph with n = 3

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Call head() on esoph
head(esoph)

# Call tail() on esoph with n = 3
tail(esoph, n = 3)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
ex() %>% {
  check_output_expr(., "head(esoph)")
  check_output_expr(., "tail(esoph, n = 3)")
}
success_msg("Wonderful! Using `head()` or `tail()` lets you explore a data frame by looking at a few rows. Another way is to look at the columns of the data frame.");
```

## Have a look at the structure

Another method that is often used to get a rapid overview of your data is the function [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str). The function [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) shows you the structure of your data set. 

For example, this is the structure of the `sleep` data frame.

```{r}
str(sleep)
##  $ extra: num  0.7 -1.6 -0.2 -1.2 -0.1 ...
##  $ group: Factor w/ 2 levels "1","2": 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ ID   : Factor w/ 10 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 ...
```

For a data frame it tells you:

- The total number of rows (or "observations"), in this case 20.
- The total number of columns (or "variables"), in this case 3.
- The name of each column (`extra`, `group`, and `ID`).
- The data type of each variable. For example, the `numeric` column `extra` is denoted `num`.
- The first observations in each column.

Applying the [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) function will often be the first thing that you do when receiving a new data set or data frame. It is a great way to get more insight in your data set before diving into the real analysis.

*** =instructions

* Investigate the structure of [`esoph`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/esoph).
* Read the output! Can you find these things?
    * How many rows and columns are there?
    * What are the two types of column?

*** =hint

* Use the [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) function on [`esoph`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/esoph).
* The number of rows is printed in the first line of the output as `m obs.`.
* The number of columns is also printed in the first line as `... of n variables`.
* `Ord.factor` is an abbreviation for an oredered factor column.
* `num` is an abbreviation for a `numeric` column.

## Creating a data frame 

Since using built-in data sets is not even half the fun of creating your own data sets, the rest of this chapter is based on your personally developed data set. Put your jet pack on because it is time for some space exploration! 

As a first goal, you want to construct a data frame that describes the main characteristics of the eight known planets in our solar system. According to your good friend Buzz, the main features of a planet are:

- The type of planet (`Terrestrial` or `Gas giant`).
- The planet's diameter relative to the diameter of the Earth.
- The planet's rotation across the sun relative to that of the Earth.
- If the planet has rings or not (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).

After doing some high-quality research on [NASA](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html), you feel confident enough to create the necessary vectors: `name`, `type`, `diameter`, `rotation` and `rings`; these vectors have already been coded up on the right. The first element in each of these vectors correspond to the first observation.

You construct a data frame with the [`data.frame()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/data.frame) function. As arguments, you pass the vectors from before: they will become the different columns of your data frame. Because every column has the same length, the vectors you pass should also have the same length. But don't forget that it is possible (and likely) that they contain different types of data.

*** =instructions
Use the function [`data.frame()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/data.frame) to construct a data frame. Pass the vectors `name`, `type`, `diameter`, `rotation` and `has_rings` as arguments to `data.frame()`, in this order. Call the resulting data frame `planets_df`.

*** =hint
Your `data.frame()` call starts as follows:
```
data.frame(planets, type, diameter)
```
Can you finish it?

## Creating a data frame (2)

The `planets_df` data frame should have 8 observations and 5 variables. It has been made available in the workspace, so you can directly use it.

*** =instructions

* Use [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) to investigate the structure of the new `planets_df` variable.
* See if you can find the following pieces of information in the output from `str()`.
    * How many rows and columns are there?
    * What are variable type does each column have?

*** =hint
`planets_df` is already available in your workspace, so `str(planets_df)` will do the trick.

## Selection of data frame elements

Data frames can make use of all the same techniques to select elements that you learned about with matrices. As before, you use square brackets, `[ ]`, and a comma to separate what you want to select from the rows and the columns respectively. For example:

- `my_df[1, 2]` selects the value at the first row and select column in `my_df`.
- `my_df[1:3, 2:4]` selects rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4 in `my_df`.

Sometimes you want to select all elements of a row or column. For example, `my_df[1, ]` selects all elements of the first row. Let us now apply this technique on `planets_df`!

*** =instructions
- From `planets_df`, select the diameter of Mercury: this is the value at the first row and the third column. Simply print out the result.
- From `planets_df`, select all data on Mars (the fourth row). Simply print out the result.

*** =hint
To select the diameter for Venus (the second row), you would need: `planets_df[2,3]`. What do you need for Mercury then?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
#load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
planets_df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"), 
  type = rep(c("Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant"), each = 4), 
  diameter = c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88), 
  rotation = c(58.8, -244, 1, 1.030, 0.415, 0.445, -0.720, 0.673), 
  has_rings = rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)
)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Print out diameter of Mercury (row 1, column 3)


# Print out data for Mars (entire fourth row)

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Print out diameter of Mercury (row 1, column 3)
planets_df[1, 3]

# Print out data for Mars (entire fourth row)
planets_df[4, ]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("planets_df[1, 3]", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected and printed out the diameter for Mercury? You can use `[1,3]`.")
test_output_contains("planets_df[4, ]", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected and printed out all data for Mars? You can use `[4, ]`.")
success_msg("Great! Apart from selecting elements from your data frame by index, you can also use the column names. To learn how, head over to the next exercise.")
```

## Selection of data frame elements (2)

Instead of using numerics to select elements of a data frame, you can also use the variable names to select columns of a data frame. 

Suppose you want to select the first three elements of the `type` column. One way to do this is

```
planets_df[1:3, 1]
```

A possible disadvantage of this approach is that you have to know (or look up) the column number of `type`, which gets hard if you have a lot of variables. It is often easier to just make use of the variable name:

```
planets_df[1:3, "type"]
```

*** =instructions
Select and print out the first 5 values in the `"diameter"` column of `planets_df`.

*** =hint
You can select the first five values with `planets_df[1:5, ...]`. Can you fill in the `...` bit to only select the `"diameter"` column?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
#load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
planets_df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"), 
  type = rep(c("Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant"), each = 4), 
  diameter = c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88), 
  rotation = c(58.8, -244, 1, 1.030, 0.415, 0.445, -0.720, 0.673), 
  has_rings = rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)
)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Select first 5 values of diameter column

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Select first 5 values of diameter column
planets_df[1:5, "diameter"]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("planets_df[1:5, \"diameter\"]", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected the first five values from the diameter column and printed them out? You can use `[1:5, \"diameter\"]` here.")
success_msg("Nice! Continue to the next exercise!")
```

## Only planets with rings

You will often want to select an entire column, namely one specific variable from a data frame. If you want to select all elements of the variable `diameter`, for example, both of these will do the trick:

```
planets_df[, 3]
planets_df[, "diameter"]
```

However, there is a short-cut. You can use the `$` sign:

```
planets_df$diameter
```

*** =instructions
- Use the `$` sign to select the `has_rings` variable from `planets_df`. Store the vector that results as `has_rings_vector`.
- Print out `has_rings_vector` to see if you got it right.

*** =hint
`planets_df$diameter` selects the `diameter` column from `planets_df`; what do you need to select the `has_rings` column then?

*** =pre_exercise_code

## Only planets with rings (2)

You probably remember from high school that some planets in our solar system have rings and others do not. But due to other priorities at that time (read: puberty) you can not recall their names, let alone their rotation speed, etc. 

Could R help you out?

If you type `has_rings_vector` in the console, you get:

```
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

This means that the first four observations (or planets) do not have a ring (`FALSE`), but the other four do (`TRUE`). However, you do not get a nice overview of the names of these planets, their diameter, etc. Let's try to use `rings_vector` to select the data for the four planets with rings. 

*** =instructions
The code on the right selects the `name` column of all planets that have rings. Adapt the code so that instead of only the `name` column, _all_ columns for planets that have rings are selected.

*** =hint
Remember that to select _all_ columns, you simply have to leave the columns part inside the `[ ]` empty! This means you'll need `[has_rings_vector, ]`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
#load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))

  type = rep(c("Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant"), each = 4), 
  diameter = c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88), 
  rotation = c(58.8, -244, 1, 1.030, 0.415, 0.445, -0.720, 0.673), 
  has_rings = rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)
)
has_rings_vector <- planets_df$has_rings
```

## Only planets with rings but shorter

So what exactly did you learn in the previous exercises? You selected a subset from a data frame (`planets_df`) based on whether or not a certain condition was true (rings or no rings), and you managed to pull out all relevant data. Pretty awesome! By now, NASA is probably already flirting with your CV 😉. 

Now, let us move up one level and use the function [`subset()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset). You should see the [`subset()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset) function as a short-cut to do exactly the same as what you did in the previous exercises. 

```
subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)
``` 

The first argument of [`subset()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset) specifies the data set for which you want a subset. By adding the second argument, you give R the necessary information and conditions to select the correct subset. 

The code below will give the exact same result as you got in the previous exercise, but this time, you didn't need the `has_rings_vector`!

```
subset(planets_df, subset = has_rings)
``` 

*** =instructions
Use `subset()` on `planets_df` to select planets that have a diameter smaller than Earth. Because the `diameter` variable is a relative measure of the planet's diameter w.r.t that of planet Earth, your condition is `diameter < 1`.

*** =hint
`subset(planets_df, subset = ...)` almost solves it; can you fill in the `...`?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
#load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
planets_df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"), 
  type = rep(c("Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant"), each = 4), 
  diameter = c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88), 
  rotation = c(58.8, -244, 1, 1.030, 0.415, 0.445, -0.720, 0.673), 
  has_rings = rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)
)
```

# Select planets with diameter < 1

## Sorting (1)

Making and creating rankings is one of mankind's favorite affairs. These rankings can be useful (best universities in the world), entertaining (most influential movie stars) or pointless (best 007 look-a-like).

In data analysis it is often helpful to see your data sorted from smallest to largest, or largest to smallest. In R, this is done with the help of two functions: [`sort()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/sort) and [`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order). 

[`sort()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/sort) is the easiest to understand, so let's consider it first. If you pass a vector to sort, it returns the values from smallest to largest.

```{r}
a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
sort(a)
## [1]   10  100 1000
```

*** =instructions

`diameter` is shown in your script.

* Use `sort()` to sort the planet diameters from smallest to largest.

*** =hint

Call `sort()`, passing `diameter` as the argument.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Planet diameters
diameter <- c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88)

# Sort the planets using sort()

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Planet diameters
diameter <- c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88)

# Sort the planets using sort()
sort(diameter)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
ex() %>% {
  check_output_expr(., "sort(diameter)")
}
success_msg("Great! Now let's use the `order()` function to sort your vector!")
```

## Sorting (2)

The other function to sort data is [`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order). This is a little trickier to understand, but it is useful because it can sort data frames.  (Unlike `sort()`, which can only sort vectors.)

[`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order) gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable, such as a vector for example:

```{r}
a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
order(a)
## [1] 2 1 3
```

10, which is the second element in `a`, is the smallest element, so 2 comes first in the output of `order(a)`. 100, which is the first element in `a` is the second smallest element, so 1 comes second in the output of `order(a)`.

This means we can use the output of `order(a)` to reshuffle `a`:
    
```{r}
positions <- order(a)
a[positions]
## [1]   10  100 1000
``` 

*** =instructions

`diameter` is shown in your script.

* Use `order()` to get the positions of planets from smallest to largest and assign the result to `positions`.
* Use square brackets to select `positions` from `diameter`.

*** =hint

* Call `order()` with `diameter` as an argument, and assign the result to `positions`.
* Call `diameter`, with `positions` inside square brackets to reshuffle by selecting elements.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}

```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Planet diameters
diameter <- c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88)

# Use order() to create positions
positions <- 

# Sort the planets using order()

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Planet diameters
diameter <- c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88)

# Use order() to create positions
positions <- order(diameter)

# Sort the planets using order()
diameter[positions]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
ex() %>% {
  check_object(., "positions") %>%
    check_equal()
  check_output_expr(., "diameter[order(diameter)]")
}
success_msg("Marvellous! `order()` is more flexible than `sort()` because it can also sort your data frame.")
```

## Sorting your data frame

Alright, now that you understand the [`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order) function, let us do something useful with it. You would like to rearrange your data frame such that it starts with the smallest planet and ends with the largest one. A sort on the `diameter` column.

*** =instructions
- Call `order()` on `planets_df$diameter` (the `diameter` column of `planets_df`). Store the result as `positions`.
- Now reshuffle `planets_df` with the `positions` vector as row indexes inside square brackets. Keep all columns. Simply print out the result.

*** =hint
- Use `order(planets_df$diameter)` to create `positions`.
- Now, you can use `positions` inside square brackets: `planets_df[...]`; can you fill in the `...`?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
#load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
planets_df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"), 
  type = rep(c("Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant"), each = 4), 
  diameter = c(0.383, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.21, 9.45, 4.01, 3.88), 
  rotation = c(58.8, -244, 1, 1.030, 0.415, 0.445, -0.720, 0.673), 
  has_rings = rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)
)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Use order() to create positions
positions <-  

# Use positions to sort planets_df

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Use order() to create positions
positions <- order(planets_df$diameter)

# Use positions to sort planets_df
planets_df[positions, ]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_object("positions",
            incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly calculated the `positions` variable? You can use `order(planets_df$diameter)`.")
test_output_contains("planets_df[positions,]",
                     incorrect_msg = "Use `planets_df[positions, ]` to sort `planets_df`; the comma inside the square brackets is crucial!")
success_msg("Wonderful! This exercise concludes the chapter on data frames. Remember that data frames are extremely important in R, you will need them all the time. Another very often used data structure is the list. This will be the subject of the next chapter!")
