  <h2>Learn R Programming<h2>

  R is the most popular programming language in the data industry thanks to its
  use of vectors and its variety of pre-processed packages. It’s in high demand
  for Data Scientists, Analysts, and Statisticians alike and is capable of
  handling AI, machine learning, financial analysis, and much more.

  <br><br>

  This introduction to R course covers the basics of this open source language,
  including vectors, factors, lists, and data frames. You’ll gain useful coding
  skills and be ready to start your own data analysis in R.

  <h2>Gain an Introduction to R<h2>

  You’ll get started with basic operations, like using the console as a
  calculator and understanding basic data types in R. Once you’ve had a chance
  to practice, you’ll move on to creating vectors and try out your new R skills
  on a data set based on betting in Las Vegas.

  Next, you’ll learn how to work with matrices in R, learning how to create
  them, and perform calculations with them. You’ll also examine how R uses
  factors to store categorical data. Finally,  you’ll explore how to work with R
  data frames and lists.
